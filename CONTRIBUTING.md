### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```bash
feat(processor): add support for multiple SPL tokens

- Implement multi-token validation logic
- Update escrow state structure
- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality

Closes #123

fix(security): prevent integer overflow in amount calculation

- Use checked arithmetic operations
- Add proper error handling
- Include regression test

Security issue reported by @security-researcher
```

### Code Style

#### Rust Guidelines

- **Formatting**: Use `rustfmt` (automatically applied)
- **Linting**: Address all `clippy` warnings
- **Naming**: Follow Rust naming conventions
- **Comments**: Use `///` for public API documentation

```rust
/// Processes the escrow initialization instruction
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `accounts` - The accounts required for escrow initialization
/// * `amount` - The expected amount in lamports
/// * `program_id` - The program's public key
/// 
/// # Errors
/// 
/// Returns `EscrowError::InvalidOwner` if token account ownership is invalid
pub fn process_init_escrow(
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    amount: u64,
    program_id: &Pubkey,
) -> ProgramResult {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Security Guidelines

- Always validate account ownership
- Use checked arithmetic operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add security-focused comments for complex logic

```rust
// Security: Verify the temp token account is owned by the initializer
// to prevent unauthorized token deposits
if temp_token_account_info.owner != *initializer.key {
    return Err(EscrowError::InvalidOwner.into());
}

// Security: Use checked addition to prevent integer overflow
let total_amount = base_amount
    .checked_add(fee_amount)
    .ok_or(EscrowError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test instruction processing
3. **Security Tests**: Test attack vectors
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths

### Writing Tests

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_escrow_initialization_success() {
        // Arrange
        let mut escrow = Escrow::default();
        let initializer_key = Pubkey::new_unique();
        let expected_amount = 1000;
        
        // Act
        escrow.is_initialized = true;
        escrow.initializer_pubkey = initializer_key;
        escrow.expected_amount = expected_amount;
        
        // Assert
        assert!(escrow.is_initialized());
        assert_eq!(escrow.initializer_pubkey, initializer_key);
        assert_eq!(escrow.expected_amount, expected_amount);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_escrow_initialization_prevents_double_init() {
        // Test double initialization prevention
    }
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_escrow_initialization

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run integration tests
cargo test-sbf
```

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage:

- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage
- **Error handling**: 100% coverage  
- **Overall project**: >90% coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report (requires tarpaulin)
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --out html
```
