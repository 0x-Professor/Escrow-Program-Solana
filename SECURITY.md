## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our users' funds is our highest priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### ðŸš¨ Critical Security Issues

For critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to loss of funds or compromise user assets, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have addressed it
3. Send an email to **[security@0x-professor.dev]** with:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our team will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Development**: We'll develop and test a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, we'll coordinate public disclosure
5. **Recognition**: We'll publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Audit Before Use**: Always audit smart contracts before interacting with them
- **Test on Devnet**: Test all interactions on Solana devnet before using mainnet
- **Verify Program ID**: Always verify you're interacting with the correct program ID
- **Check Account Ownership**: Ensure all accounts are owned by expected programs
- **Monitor Transactions**: Review all transaction details before signing

### For Developers

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must undergo thorough peer review
- **Automated Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like Clippy and other security linters
- **Formal Verification**: Consider formal verification for critical components

## Common Security Considerations

### Account Validation

```rust
// Always validate account ownership
if account.owner != expected_program_id {
    return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
}

// Verify signer requirements
if !account.is_signer {
    return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
}
```

### Rent Exemption

```rust
// Ensure accounts are rent-exempt
if !rent.is_exempt(account.lamports(), account.data_len()) {
    return Err(EscrowError::NotRentExempt.into());
}
```

### Numeric Overflow

```rust
// Use checked arithmetic operations
let result = amount
    .checked_add(fee)
    .ok_or(ProgramError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;
```

### PDA Security

```rust
// Always verify PDA derivation
let (expected_pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"escrow"], program_id);
if expected_pda != *pda_account.key {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidSeeds);
}
```

## Known Security Measures

### Implemented Protections

1. **Signer Verification**: All critical operations require proper signatures
2. **Account Ownership Validation**: Strict validation of account ownership
3. **Rent Exemption Checks**: Prevents account deallocation attacks
4. **Amount Validation**: Prevents integer overflow and underflow
5. **Initialization Guards**: Prevents double-initialization attacks
6. **PDA Authority**: Secure token custody using Program Derived Addresses

### Security Audits

- **Internal Audits**: Conducted by the development team
- **Peer Reviews**: All code changes reviewed by multiple developers
- **Community Testing**: Open source code allows community auditing

*We plan to conduct professional security audits before mainnet deployment.*

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

- **GitHub Releases**: Critical security updates will be published as releases
- **README Updates**: Important security information will be updated in README
- **Community Channels**: Updates shared via GitHub Discussions

### Update Process

1. **Immediate Fixes**: Critical vulnerabilities receive immediate patches
2. **Version Bumps**: Security fixes trigger version updates
3. **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes include migration documentation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: We maintain backward compatibility when possible

## Bug Bounty Program

*We are considering implementing a bug bounty program. Details will be announced if/when the program launches.*

### Scope (Proposed)

- **In Scope**: 
  - Smart contract vulnerabilities
  - Logic errors leading to fund loss
  - Access control bypasses
  - Integer overflow/underflow issues

- **Out of Scope**:
  - Client-side vulnerabilities
  - Social engineering attacks
  - Issues in third-party dependencies
  - Denial of service attacks

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Vulnerability Response

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Temporary Mitigation**: Implement temporary fixes if possible
3. **Stakeholder Notification**: Inform key stakeholders and users
4. **Patch Development**: Develop and test comprehensive fixes
5. **Coordinated Deployment**: Deploy fixes with minimal disruption

### Communication Plan

- **Public Advisory**: Issue public security advisories for all vulnerabilities
- **User Notifications**: Direct notifications for users of affected versions
- **Developer Updates**: Technical details shared with development community

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards

- **OWASP**: Following OWASP smart contract security guidelines
- **Solana Best Practices**: Adhering to Solana security recommendations
- **Industry Standards**: Following blockchain security best practices

### Regular Reviews

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Regular security posture assessments
- **Dependency Audits**: Regular review of all dependencies
- **Code Quality Gates**: Automated security checks in CI/CD pipeline
